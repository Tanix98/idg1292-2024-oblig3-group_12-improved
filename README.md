# Scrollytelling ocean pollution

## Project overview and purpose

-   Decided to focus on UN sustainability goal 14
-   Display issues of dumping plastic in the ocean, on how that affects the life in the ocean, including the fish we eat

## Brainstorming session

Plastic that falls from a fishing boat and down to the bottom of the ocean. The ocean gets darker the longer you scroll down. Shows the source of ocean pollution. Fishing line that goes almost all the way down, pulls up garbage.

Life of a fish.

Fish eats plastic like pac-man, going across the screen.

Can click on some plastic to remove it from the ocean.

Story follows plastic thrown from a fishing boat, goes down into the ocean and gets eaten by fish, fish gets caught in a fish hook and gets eaten by the person that threw the plastic the fish ate.

Slide 1, boat on ocean. Slide 2, boat throws plastic in ocean. Slide 3, plastic goes down into the ocean. Slide 4, fish eats plastic. Slide 5, fish gets taken by fishhook/fishing line. Slide 6, fish is on a dinner plate, shows plastic inside fish. The last slide is interactive, clicking to eat fish, reveals plastic inside fish.
